#Hello!

My name is Adam Secrest (Secrest2904), and this is my Github Homepage! I am currently a 
student at Cal State Fullerton majoring in Computer Science and planning on concentrating 
in Cybersecurity.

#### CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 04 Part 1

	Lab 4 gave me one of the greatest sense-of-accomplishment feelings out of all of my labs. 
Although not nearly the most complex lab I have done, this lab is the result of many trials and 
errors in trying to integrate functions for the first time. The satisfaction of having the various 
pieces of my code come together and give me the correct solution revived a motivation to pursue 
computer science, which is why this lab is special to me. 

* Lab 07 Part 1

	Lab 7 was fun altogether, as it required intuition into the math behind both parts. Lab 1 
especially, however, brought me a lot of joy to code. With the assignment to calculate the difference 
in days between two dates, I was able to creatively use my acquired coding skills up until that 
moment to create my very own code. Although I had been the one to write code in many of the previous 
labs, this lab contained the first code that felt like my own work rather than the result of 
following a template. This is why I loved working on lab 7, part 1 particularly. 

* Lab 10 Part 2

	Lab 10 provided a challenge that I could not tackle alone. Although every lab of mine grew 
exponentially in difficulty, Lab 10 had been some of the most confused I have ever been. Fortunately, 
thanks to a great partner and helpful classmates, I was not only able to finish the lab, but by the end 
of it could explain how and why everything fit together to achieve the final goal of reading external 
files and placing the read data into 2D vectors.
